### Context:

This is not typical in fully decentralized systems — but some projects use these types of contracts during early stages or for trusted recovery mechanisms. It’s often controversial because it adds centralization risk.
----------------------------------------------------------

### Basic Idea:

- Funds are deposited into the contract.

- An admin/guardian or multisig can trigger a recovery function to redirect funds to the rightful owner.

- Optional: include timelocks or emergency-only conditions to limit abuse.
 --------------------------------------------------------------

### How This Could Be Used:

- Let’s say someone’s wallet is compromised and funds are stolen into this contract (e.g., a DAO vault or yield strategy).

- The team could manually reassign the funds using the recover() function.
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Risks:

- Admin access is powerful — this contract is not trustless.

- Attackers who gain admin access could steal everything.

- In a decentralized setup, you’d want to wrap recover() in a governance proposal + timelock to avoid abuse.
