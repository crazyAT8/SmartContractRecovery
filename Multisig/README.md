## 1. Multisig-Controlled Recovery

In this case, we’ll assume the DAO uses a Gnosis Safe (or similar multisig wallet) as the admin. The vault contract stays the same, but you set the admin to the multisig address during deployment.
Then, all admin calls (like recover()) must be submitted and approved through the multisig UI, requiring M-of-N signatures.

This is common in projects like Yearn, Synthetix, etc.

## 2. Timelock + DAO Governance

Here’s a simplified system where:

- A Timelock contract queues and executes admin actions after a delay.

- The Vault accepts only calls from the Timelock.

- A DAO (like a Governor contract) proposes and schedules these actions.
